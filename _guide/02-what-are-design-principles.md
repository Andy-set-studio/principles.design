<p class="h3 bold">Design Principles are a concise set of guidelines that assist in decision-making. </p>

---
They're comprised of a group of simple words or phrases. They exist to influence thinking, decisions, culture and process.

Design principles turn a shared vision or concept into something tangible and understandable.

For example:

* Something
* Something
* Something

Taken from [real example](/examples/).

Design Principles add a tremendous amount of value to concepts, brands, processes, projects, products and teams.

Unlike rigid rules they're designed to be flexible.

Some design principles are written for brands, others are written for products or concepts.

### To illustrate
It's important for a website to load quickly. A product team working on a website could enforce the rule "All web pages must load in under 3 seconds". The initial objective is a really positive one. However when expressed as a rule is it as effective in decision-making as a principle such as "Make every single kilobyte count"?.

~~With a set rule, over time the website may likely end up loading in under 2 seconds, or even in 1 second. That's great. But it would be quite easy in time for the page load time to creep back up to 3 seconds as dependencies, features and kilobytes are slowly added. If the site loaded in 2 seconds and a new feature was added to the website that took a second to load… you're still meeting your objective but have you have taken a step backwards?~~

Does the rule "All web pages must load in under 3 seconds" take the real world into context? A site may well load in under 3 seconds on high speed wifi but what if it took 27 seconds to load on a low speed mobile signal? Would this meet your objective?

The principle "Make every single kilobyte count" would bring into question and promote discussion about the value of each kilobyte. It would influence your priorities, content and approach in a positive way.

This principle would help a team make the right trade-offs for the right context and ensure value is added with each piece of content and each line of code.

There are two types of Design Principle; _Specific_ and _Universal_.

## Specific

Specific design principles are unique to a project, product or team. They are used to align a team's thinking to assist with decision-making.

## Universal

Universal principles tend to be be longer and verbose. They're more descriptive and their aim is to simplify the understanding of a complex theme. They cover broad concepts such as "The Principles of UX" or the "Principles of Design".
