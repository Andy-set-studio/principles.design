[principles.design](https://principles.design) is an open source resource designed to help you understand and create Design Principles.

It is managed by [Ben Brignell](https://twitter.com/benbrignell) and hopefully soon a [bunch of lovely contributors on GitHub](https://github.com/benbrignell/design-principles/graphs/contributors).

There's a few more things to come which are listed on the [roadmap](https://github.com/benbrignell/design-principles/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aroadmap).
