## This is an open source resource to help you understand and create Design Principles.

It is managed by [Ben Brignell](https://benbrignell.com), an independent product designer from London, England. If you or your organisation want to book a one or two-day workshop to help your team write design principles then [please get in touch](https://brignell.uk).

This project is a work in progress. There are still a few more things to come which are listed on the [roadmap](https://github.com/benbrignell/design-principles/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aroadmap).
