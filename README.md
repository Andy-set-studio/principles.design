## How to contribute

There are two ways to contribute. You don't need to be able to code but you will need a (free) [GitHub](https://github.com) account in order to contribute.

### The easy ish-way
Navigate to the `_examples` folder

Create new file

You'll see an empty text area to paste your design principles into
Give it a descriptive file name (for example here I'm adding Design Well Inc's design principles and have called the file `design-well-in.md`)

Paste in your design principles. You'll need to format them based on a template which can be found here:

Scroll down to the bottom of the text area and 'Propose new file'. Give this a message, for example `added example design-well-inc.md`

Create pull request

<img width="1000" alt="screenshot 2017-12-04 11 37 21" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/362340/33551422-3b685812-d8e9-11e7-89ea-67639e8f0893.png">

Confirm pull request
Give it a quick check, make sure everything looks ok

<img width="997" alt="screenshot 2017-12-04 11 37 38" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/362340/33551432-3e86e5f4-d8e9-11e7-93b6-0fd5ea9c5d65.png">

Once a pull request is made it will be reviewed and if everything is ok it'll be merged in and appear on the site. It may take a few days for this to happen.

### The harder-ish way
Checkout the this repo and fire up jekyll (more instructions to follow in the next few days)
