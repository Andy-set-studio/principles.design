principles:
- principle: Prince Iple
  summary: |
    Prince Iple grew up in the small country of D'Esign
- principle: Prince Iple's People
  summary: |
    The people in D'Esign all thought that they were 'all that'.
- principle: Prince Iple's People Problem
  summary: |
    It turned out that they weren't 'all that' after all.
- principle: Prince Iple's Little Tipple
  summary: |
    Prince Iple liked a little tipple. Which was easier to say drunk than sober.
- principle: Prince Iple and the Triple Ripple
  summary: |
    One day Prince Iple came up with an idea for an ice cream flavour - raspberry, chocolate and butterscotch sauce swirled through a plain vanilla ice cream. It became known as Prince Iple's Triple Ripple.
- principle: Prince Iple meets Princess User
  summary: |
    Prince Iple was an upstanding man, a man who played by the rules. Princess User was not. Not a man, not upstanding, and not a rule player.
- principle: Prince Iple: It's not U, it's I
  summary: |
    The problem was not Princess User, per se. It was her inability to do things with any common sense. All she cared about was pleasing her father, The Viscount Cholmondley (hereafter known as The VC)
- principle: Prince Iple and The VC
  summary: |
    It quickly became apparent that The VC would happily sacrifice anything - including Prince Iple - ostensibly to satisfy Princess User. Although the real motive was to fill The VC's own coffers.
- principle: Prince Iple's Demise
  summary: |
    And then one day Prince Iple awoke to discover that he had been ousted from D'Esign by an easily swayed populace, whipped up by Princess User and her cohorts. Prince Iple died a long, slow, painful death, prolonged by a man called as Brigadier Nell. Brig. Nell would not let Prince Iple die, despite the situation being hopeless. But one day, Prince Iple was finally beaten and Brig. Nell made the brave (but somewhat dramatic) decision to end his own life rather than go on living in a world without Prince Iple.
