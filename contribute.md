## There are many ways to contribute to this website

Everyone can add value and help in one way or another. You don't need to be a designer or know how to code in order to contribute.

### Submissions

You don't need to be a giant organisation or a famous designer who has written a book and has 72.4 million followers on Twitter to submit a set of personal Design Principles.

We want to ensure any sets of Principles submitted are something the community can learn from. There's not much value in a repository filled with 100s of examples of vague and generic principles so here are some basic guidelines:

#### Guidelines

Submissions need to contain the following:

* A set of original Design Principles
* Evidence (a source article, blog post or page listing a set of design principles in more detail) about how you or your team came up with those principles. What you learnt. What worked, what didn't work. How do you follow these principles? Have they made your process better? How?

You can submit examples from other individuals, companies or teams that you think would be useful to the community that follow these guidelines too.

For more information and documentation about how to submit [take a look at the GitHub page](https://github.com/benbrignell/principles.design#contributing).

### Help needed

Each set of principles in [examples](/examples) is comprised of a number of things. For example:
* Overview
* Summary of each principle
* Source URL
* Author/creator

If any of these things are missing you'll see a "Help needed" message at the bottom of the page highlighting which things are missing.

If you want to help [visit the GitHub page for more info](https://github.com/benbrignell/principles.design#contributing).

### Roadmap
Take a look at the [roadmap](https://github.com/benbrignell/design-principles/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aroadmap) and feel free to comment or add suggestions.
