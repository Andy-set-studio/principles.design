Design Principles are a set of considerations that help inform decisions. There are two types. _Universal_ and _Specific_.

## Universal

Universal principles tend to be be longer and verbose. They cover broad concepts such as "The Principles of UX" or the "Principles of Design".

## Specific

Specific design principles are used to help decision-making with teams on projects/products. Specific design principles are unique to a project, product or team. For example "Examples".

Inform decisions. Help.

## Format

Typically design principles are comprised of two things.

### A title or short phrase
Example "Conversational" or "Create a conversational environment".

### A brief paragraph or summary describing the motives and objectives behind the principle

Example "Blah blah"
