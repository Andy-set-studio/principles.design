## There are many ways to contribute to this website

You don't need to be a designer or know how to code in order to contribute to the site or community. Everyone can add value and help in one way or another.

### Submissions

Submissions are welcome from anyone. You don't need to be a giant organisation or a famous designer who has written a book and has 72.4 million followers on Twitter to submit a set of personal Design Principles.

We want to ensure any sets of Principles submitted are something the community can learn from. There's not much value in a repository filled with 100s of examples of vague and generic principles.

#### Guidelines

Submissions need to contain the following:

* A set of original Design Principles
* Evidence (a source article, blog post or explanation) about how you or your team came up with those principles. What you learnt. What worked, what didn't work. How do you follow these principles? Have they made your process better? How?

You can submit examples from other individuals, companies or teams that you think would be useful to the community that follow these guidelines too.

For more information and documentation about how to submit [take a look at the GitHub page](https://github.com/benbrignell/principles.design#contributing).

### Help needed

Each set of principles in [examples](/examples) has a number of things (such as an **overview**, a **summary** of each principle, **source URL** and so on) to help us gain more insight into the principles we're looking at.

If any of these things are missing you'll see a "Help needed" message at the bottom of the page highlighting which things are missing.

If you want to help [visit the GitHub page for more info](https://github.com/benbrignell/principles.design#contributing).

### Issues

This site will only improve and be more useful with feedback from the community.

#### Bugs

If something looks weird or broken [create an issue](https://github.com/benbrignell/principles.design/issues) to let us know.

#### Feedback

Feedback is welcome as long as it's constrictive.  

### Roadmap
There's a lot of things to come and a lot of questions to answer about how we can learn from Design Principles. Take a look at the [roadmap](https://github.com/benbrignell/design-principles/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aroadmap) and feel free to comment or add suggestions.
