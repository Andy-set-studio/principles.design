<p class="h3 bold">Design Principles are a set of considerations that help inform decisions. They support an approach to a process. Unlike rigid rules they're designed to be flexible whilst supporting a common goal.</p>


To illustrate; it's important for a website to load quickly. A product team working on a website could enforce the rule "All web pages must load in under 3 seconds". The initial objective may be a positive one. However when expressed as a rule it may not be as effective in decision-making as a principle such as "Make every single kilobyte count".

With a set rule, over time the website may likely end up loading in under 2 seconds, or even in 1 second. That's great. But it would probably be quite easy in time for the page load time to creep back up to 3 seconds as dependencies, features and kilobytes are slowly added. If the site loaded in 2 seconds and a new feature was added to the website that took a second to loadâ€¦ you're still meeting your objective but have you have taken a step backwards?

Does the rule "All web pages must load in under 3 seconds" take the real world into context? A site may well load in under 3 seconds on high speed wifi but what if it took 27 seconds to load on a low speed mobile signal? Would this meet your objective?

The principle "Make every single kilobyte count" would bring into question and promote discussion about the value of each kilobyte. It would influence your priorities, content and approach in a positive way.

This principle would help a team make the right trade-offs for the right context and ensure value is added with each piece of content and each line of code.

Design Principles work in many ways, they're not just for teams or individuals. There are two types of Design Principle; _Universal_ and _Specific_.


## Universal

Universal principles tend to be be longer and verbose. They cover broad concepts such as "The Principles of UX" or the "Principles of Design".

## Specific

Specific design principles are used to help decision-making with teams on projects/products. Specific design principles are unique to a project, product or team. For example "Examples".

Inform decisions. Help.

## Format

Typically design principles are comprised of two things.

### A title or short phrase
Example "Conversational" or "Create a conversational environment".

### A brief paragraph or summary describing the motives and objectives behind the principle

Example "Blah blah"
